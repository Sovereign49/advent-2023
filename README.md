# Advent of Code 2023

This is a repo to track my process learning c++ for advent of code 2023

The folder structure is labeled by date, `day-1` being the first of December and so on. To make things simple I will just use a Makefile for each folder, which will be the same for each one.

Code is written so that it functions on x86_64 Linux, if it doesn't compile on your system try running it in a VM, Container, or use WSL if on Windows.

To run the code on a standard Linux machine compile both parts by running build.sh and then use the run script by running the command `sh run.sh <part number>`

Look at the `day-test` folder for an idea of how the file-structure is laid out.
