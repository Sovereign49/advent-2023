# Advent of Code 2023

This is a repo to track my process learning c++ for advent of code 2023

The folder structure is labeled by date, 1 being the first of December and so on. To make things simple I will just use a Makefile for each folder as to practice making a Makefile.

I won't bother keeping the binaries out of the git repo since this isn't a serious project. Dealing with all the binaries would be time-consuming.

Note that all binaries compiled are compiled for x86_64 Linux. Binaries for other operating systems aren't a priority.
